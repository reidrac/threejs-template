This a simple template to bootstrap a three.js project.

1. Add three.min.js to the `js/` directory.
2. Read the code (it's commented).
3. ...
4. Profit!

I've included a simple HTTP server that can be used to develop
locally. It requires Python 2.

This code is in the public domain, use it for anything you
want (at your own risk). You don't even need to give me credit!
